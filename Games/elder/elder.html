    <p>The Elder Scrolls Online, just like previous Elder Scrolls games, can be played in either a first or third-person perspective. Gameplay is mostly non-linear, with a mixture of quests, random events, and free-roaming exploration of the world.[8] It does not provide a mode for single-player offline play, although the developers stated that there would be "plenty of content" for online solo play.[9]

        The player chooses between ten different races:
        
        Humans: Nords, Redguards, Bretons, and (with separate purchase) Imperials
        Elvish races: Dunmer (Dark Elves), Altmer (High Elves), Bosmer (Wood Elves), and Orsimer (Orcs)
        Bestial races: Khajiit and Argonians
        Players choose one of seven classes when creating a character: Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Nightblade, Templar, Warden, Necromancer, or Arcanist. Each class gives the player various different attacks, spells, and passive effects. The game has other character choices beyond those of race and class, such as the player character also being able to become either a vampire or a werewolf, each of which grants its own skill tree. There are seven different crafting skill lines: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Clothier, Enchanting, Woodworking, Provisioning, and Jewelry Crafting. </p>
