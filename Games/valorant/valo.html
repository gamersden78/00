    <p>When Riot Games decided to expand its portfolio into the competitive tactical shooter space, it wasn’t doing so lightly. Valorant, originally codenamed “Project A”, officially launched in June of 2020. Its build up to being fully out in the wild was relatively short compared to a lot of other competitive titles (it was first teased in late 2019), but such was the confidence the gaming and esports giant had in its tilt on the genre. And while comparisons to Blizzard’s Overwatch were thick and fast in the early days (and are even still now, erroneously), there’s a sense that the tactical side of Valorant is more akin to Counter Strike than its more colourful competitor.
        This tactical lean has given Valorant a mature edge over all of its contemporaries, with many professional players preferring it in the crowded space -- a sentiment that seeps into an edgier, more underground pathway for younger players looking to not only cut their teeth on the tactical shooter market, but to also solidify themselves and their skills in the more refined game. (This writer’s pre-teen prefers Valorant over all other titles -- it’s all he talks about!) </p>
